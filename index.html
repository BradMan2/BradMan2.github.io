				<p>My son is officially two months old and I have a functional prototype web-blog. That is what I am choosing to call it anyways. I am still using sublime text it seems to be a super easy way for me to just run through demo items that are presented to me through M1M0. Of course without the app I would have to watch video after video to figure out what I need. I solved the problem with the text color of the "contact" and "about" links in the upper right hand corner. In doing so I created other problems but I was able to fix those as well. I am super glad I did too it was really bugging me having phantom links. If you want to know what happened shoot me an email through that "contact" button! -Brad</p>
				<p>P. S. I am still using this app M1M0 <u><a id="mimo" href="https://getmimo.com">("click here")</a></u> to check them out!

				<p>If someone had told me it would be just shy of my son becoming two months old to actually take programming seriously. I would probably nod my head and say "yeah that seems like me" and here we are 11/6/2019 the day before my son turns two months old. I have just now found a decent media to use for programming, as well as a good course for learning.</p>
				<p>I have been using <a id="mimo" href="https://getmimo.com">M1M0</a> since before my son was born and I discovered <strong>Sublime Text</strong> long before that. I have the support of my friends, <strong><em>fiance</em></strong> and multiple co-workers. I will see how far this goes as I want to see everything work for myself most of all.</p>

			<p id="theStory">Hi there my name is Brad Street and my passion is actually mobile application development. So far all I have are prototypes. I am attempting my hand at some HTML with the aid of <strong><em>SUBLIME TEXT</em></strong> and of course my <a id="mimos" href="https://getmimo.com"><u>M1M0</u></a> app on my cell phone.</p>
